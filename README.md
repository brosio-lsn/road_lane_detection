# Road Lane Detection

## Overview
The Road Lane Detection program is designed for use in self-driving car systems. It employs advanced computer vision techniques to accurately identify and track road lanes in videos, a critical component for autonomous navigation.

## Features
- Real-time road lane detection.
- Utilizes computer vision algorithms for lane tracking.
- Essential for autonomous driving systems and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).

## Technical Details
- Written in Python, leveraging libraries like OpenCV for image processing.
- The algorithm processes video input to detect lane lines on roads.
- Suitable for integration with self-driving car systems.

## Usage
To use the program, run the `main.py` script. Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed, including OpenCV.
